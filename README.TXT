Contents of this directory as of 2017/11/02
change-EC2instances.ps1		| works in POC but not flushed out in prod. this can be used to change
				| instance type from - say r4.large to r4.xlarge. Need IAM privilege to do so
mon-put-metrics-mem.ps1		| injects metrics into Cloudwatch
FVarNodes.conf			| sample config file that defines the compute nodes in the Fvar group
prep-new-ComputeNodes.ps1	| works in POC, used to authorize compute nodes as members of the cluster
				| not really used in prod
FRMDefaultNodes.conf		| sample config file that defines the compute nodes in the FRMDefault group
FRMHPC_AutoStart-Stop.ps1	| script which monitors jobs in queue and start/stop compute nodes
				| this is scheduled as FRMHPC AutoStart-Stop Task in the Task Scheduler
README.TXT			| this file
setSubscribedCores.ps1		| used to manipulate the # of subscribed cores on a compute node (i.e. how
				| many threads each compute node will take when running
startCOMNodesForPatching.ps1	| starts compute nodes for patching and disables the FRMHPC AutoStart-Stop job
				| referenced by startCOMNodesForPatching Scheduled Task
stopCOMNodesAfterPatching.ps1	| stops compute nodes after patching and enables/runs the FRMHPC AutoStart-Stop job
				| referenced by stopCOMNodesAfterPatching Scheduled Task
templates			| FRM templates (FRMDefault, FVar, and ETL/SSIS) to be imported into HPC

Folders
logs				| log files generated by the scheduled tasks	
sampleJobs			| sample job that can be used to test the HPC cluster
ScheduledTasks			| definition of the tasks in Task Scheduler. Import these into Task Scheduler and 
				| run using < Service account> credential
				| 3 STs: FRMHPC AutoStart-Stop, startCOMNodesForPatching, and stopCOMNodesAfterPatching
scripts				| scripts that can be used to stop/start critical components (HPC win services, 
				| FRM win services, Task in Task Scheduler)
